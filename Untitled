  Summary of next steps for Haiti.

1. Establish the set of EGRA items used over all countries. Those are the subtasks we will focus on in each Haiti.

2. The main disaggregating factor are

  a. Tx (control, TA TA+)
  b. Corridor ({1,2}, and 3)
  c. Grade (1 and 2)
  d. Year (Baseline Endline in 2013 -2014)
  e. Language (French, Creole)

a. We only care about control and TA (TA+ was not administered everywhere, and did not seem effective)

b. We will have to consider MI over these groups .

c. Grade -- we need to confirm that the same version of the EGRA was used in both grades. If not, we need to disaggregate everything by grade. If the same version was used, then we can test this for MI also.

d. Our focal year is endline. We can look at MI at baseline later on.

e. Lets focus on Creole first, since French did not use all subtask.


In sum, we want to compare MI for control versus TA. If the grades did not use the same version of EGRA, need to disaggregate everything by grade. If they did use the same version, test MI over grade. Also need to test MI over corridor.


Assuming the same version of EGRA was used in each grade:

Analysis 1
! overall
useobs = (year EQ 2014)
group = treatment(0 = control , 1 = TA);

Analysis 2 and 3
! between grades
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND grade EQ 1)
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND grade EQ 2)
useobs = (year EQ 2014)

Analysis 4 and 5
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND corridor EQ 3)
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND corridor NE 3)
useobs = (year EQ 2014)

Analysis 6,7,8,9
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND grade EQ 1 AND corridor EQ 3)
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND grade EQ 1 AND corridor NE 3)
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND grade EQ 2 AND corridor EQ 3)
useobs = (year EQ 2014 AND grade EQ 2 AND corridor NE 3)
