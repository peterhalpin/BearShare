# PV bootstrap for EM
	1) generate theta
	2) run EM save posteriors and priors
	3) average SE over runs is sampling error
	4) SE of average over runs is measurement error

# lr bootstrap for EM
	1) get EM posteriors
	2) sample proportion of draws from each model
	2a) check that EM recovers parms from simulated data
	3) follow usual bootstrap procedure
