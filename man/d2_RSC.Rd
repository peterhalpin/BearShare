\title{Second derivatives of the IRF of the one-parameter RSC model.}
\usage{
d2_RSC(u, parms, theta1, theta2)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{the logit of the weight parameter of the RSC model.}

\item{parms}{a data.frame with columns \code{parms$alpha} and \code{parms$beta} corresponding to the discrimination and difficulty parameters of the 2PL model, respectively.}

\item{theta1}{the latent trait of member 1.}

\item{theta2}{the latent trait of member 2.}
}
\value{
a named list of second derivatives, with elements \code{c("dw_dtheta1", "dw_dtheta2", "d2theta1", "d2theta2", "dtheta1_dtheta2")}.
}
\description{
Computes a named list of second derivatives of the IRF of the one-parameter RSC model. Uses 2PL model for individual responses.
