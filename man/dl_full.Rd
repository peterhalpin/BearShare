\title{Gradient of the log-likelihood of a combined assessment.}
\usage{
dl_full(resp, w, parms, theta1, theta2)
}
\arguments{
\item{resp}{a data.frame containing the binary item responses of both the individual assessment and the (conjunctively scored) group assessment. See details for information on formatting.}

\item{w}{the weight parameter of the RSC model.}

\item{parms}{a named list or data.frame with elements \code{parms$alpha} and \code{parms$beta} corresponding to the discrimination and difficulty parameters of the 2PL model, respectively. See details for information on formatting.}

\item{theta1}{the latent trait of member 1.}

\item{theta2}{the latent trait of member 2.}
}
\value{
\code{3 * K} - vector of first derivatives, with \code{K = length(w)}, ordered as \code{rep(c(w_k, theta1_k, theta2_k), times = K)}.
}
\description{
This function computes first derivatives of the log-likelihood for a combined assessment, in which the 2PL model is used for the individual component of the assessment and the one-parameter RSC model is used for the group component of the assessment. The derivatives are taken in \code{c(w, theta1, theta2)}. See \code{help(l_full)} for details on formatting \code{resp} and \code{parms}.
