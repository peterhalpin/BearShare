\title{First derivatives of the IRF of the one-parameter RSC model.}
\usage{
d_RSC(w, parms, theta1, theta2)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{the weight parameter of the RSC model.}

\item{parms}{a named list or data.frame with elements \code{parms$alpha} and \code{parms$beta} corresponding to the discrimination and difficulty parameters of the 2PL model, respectively.}

\item{theta1}{the latent trait of member 1.}

\item{theta1}{the latent trait of member 2.}
}
\value{
a named list of derivatives, with elements \code{c("dw", "dtheta1", "dtheta2")}.
}
\description{
Computes a named list of derivatives of the IRF of the one-parameter RSC model. Uses 2PL model for individual responses. See Appendix of Halpin & Bergner (2017) for details.
